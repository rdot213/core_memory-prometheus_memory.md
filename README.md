# 🌐 Language Learning AI

Welcome to the **Language Learning AI system**, part of the larger **Project Prometheus HQ** initiative.

This is the **core application** repo — where we’re designing a modular, intelligent, and culturally-aware language learning experience. Built for mobile, optimized with AI, and structured with multi-agent logic.

---

## 🧠 Core Purpose

To create a **universal language tutor platform** that:
- Delivers lessons in multiple spoken and signed languages (e.g. Korean, Spanish, ASL)
- Supports interactive, agent-powered instruction (Polyglot Professor, Silent Tongue)
- Enables cultural and contextual understanding
- Is accessible, mobile-first, and scalable

---

## 🧩 Key Components

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| 🧑🏾‍🏫 **Polyglot Professor** | Main instructor agent. Delivers structured language lessons and retention checks |
| ✋🏾 **Silent Tongue** | Handles ASL content — glosses, gesture instruction, and cultural notes |
| 🧱 **Lesson Builder (WIP)** | Tools to construct, visualize, and test multilingual lesson flows |
| 📲 **Mobile UI (Coming Soon)** | Frontend optimized for mobile learning experience |
